# MetarBot

metarBot is a weather utility for operators of small unmanned aerial systems. It's designed to help reduce the need to check multiple websites for weather reports, meteorological aerodrome reports (aka METARs), and other sources used by commercial and hobbyist drone pilots.  

## Platforms, tools, libraries, and frameworks

metarBot is written using the following:

- Angular v13.x
- Tailwind CSS
- Netlify and Netlify functions 
- Supabase 
- AVWX - A publicly available, open source REST API for aviation weather.

## Current release

metarBot remains a work in progress.  The current state of this repo is approaching the MVP envisioned when I understook the project.  

## Planned features and enhancements

Below is a list of a few of the features that will be rolled out in future releases:

- TAF output - Add the option to include TAF data (at stations where available) to the METAR output
- Dashboard functionality - The ability to save frequently searched IATA/ICAO codes to the backend
- Implement the backend design using Supabase which is currently only for authentication which is not tied to functionality any existing
